# ArmorStand-Limiter

### allows you to limit armor stands, so you can fix TPS drops caused by a high number of ArmorStands in your server!
### Can be used in all modalities and is fully and easily configurable thanks to its intuitive configuration file.

### This plugin was created with the express purpose of fixing LAG problems caused by other plugins that generate and do not remove custom Armor Stands within a single block!
### Later we also thought of adding other functions to avoid lagging machines caused by Armor Stands, like this one in the picture

## Feature
* The most important function is that of removing CUSTOM Armor Stands ( created by other plugins ) that exceed the preset limit in a single block or chunk!
* Set Armor Stand limit in a Block and/or a Chunk
* Check the world name, armor stand type and its name to avoid unwanted removal
* Timer that checks every X minutes in the loaded chunks the number of Armor Stands inside the chunk or in the single block
* Check TPS status and if too low check and remove the Armor Stands in a sigle block or chunk ( this check is also performed only on loaded chunks )
* Ability to limit players to placing a maximum of Armor Stands per chunk
* Ability to disable that the Armor Stand can be moved by the pistons or blocks connected to it
* Ability to disable that Armor Stand can move in the water
* Ability to disable that Armor Stand can be spawned through dispensers
* Customized notification ( inGame, Discord, Telegram and Console ) of when Armor Stands are removed due to limit violation
